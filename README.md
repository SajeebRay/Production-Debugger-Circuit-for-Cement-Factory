# Production-Debugger-Circuit-for-Cement-Factory
_This Project was did for the industrial solution purpose_
<br><br>
Problem Statement: In the subjected factory, they use two production lines of cement bag packing. But these lines are not synchronously perform their task. That causes the bag overlapping on the conveyor belt. Also, they want to count the total number number of bag.
